Just got off rotation and had to share this — we saw something wild last week near the southern AO. We were on night watch when three small fixed-wing drones came buzzing in low. Normally, that means scrambling for cover or jamming, but not this time. About 100 meters from our position was a weird-looking system — tripod-mounted dish, chunky base, looked like a cross between a radar and a mortar. As soon as the drones came into view, it auto-tracked them and let off a faint shimmer in the air — no sound, no flash, just a weird pressure pop. Seconds later, all three drones dropped like stones. No explosions. No jamming interference on our gear. Just clean kills. We later heard it’s called Glaive — a prototype ground-based anti-UAS system. Uses directed energy or microwave pulses to fry drone electronics. Quiet, invisible, and fast. Best part? It’s portable — two-person carry, under 10 minutes to deploy, and it fits in a Stryker if needed. Range? Heard it’s up to 1 km with a generator. Day/night capable. Totally silent signature. Honestly, it was the first time I felt like we had the upper hand against these things. Anyone else seen this thing in action? Curious how wide it’s being deployed.
